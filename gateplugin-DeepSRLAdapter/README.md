# gateplugin-DeepSRLAdapter
Integrate DeepSRL into GATE

This is a java wrapper to execute the DeepSRL approach (https://github.com/luheng/deep_srl), parse the STDOUT and add annotations to GATE as a Processing Resource.

It does not bundle DeepSRL, as it has its own license (see https://github.com/luheng/deep_srl/blob/master/LICENSE).
